## Prediction of Homes in California

This project focuses on predicting home prices in California using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information about housing attributes, which are utilized to develop predictive models.


### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is housing.csv, which contains the following columns:

longitude: Longitude of the house location.

latitude: Latitude of the house location.

housing_median_age: Median age of the houses in the area.

total_rooms: Total number of rooms in the house.

total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms in the house.

population: Population of the area.

households: Number of households in the area.

median_income: Median income of the area.

median_house_value: Median house value (target variable).

ocean_proximity: Proximity to the ocean (categorical feature).
